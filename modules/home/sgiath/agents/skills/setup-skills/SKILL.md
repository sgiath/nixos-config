# Setup Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (Linear by default; local markdown backed by backlog.md is also supported out of the box)
- **Triage labels** — the strings used for the five canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs** — where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config` — is this a GitHub repo? Which one?
- `AGENTS.sgiath.md` at the repo root — does it exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in it? This file (not `AGENTS.md`) is where this skill writes: it holds the user's personal instructions, is git-ignored, and is intentionally not shared with the team. Never write the `## Agent skills` block into `AGENTS.md`.
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.backlog/` — sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then walk the user through the three decisions **one at a time** — present a section, get the user's answer, then move to the next. Don't dump all three at once.

Assume the user does not know what these terms mean. Each section starts with a short explainer (what it is, why these skills need it, what changes if they pick differently). Then show the choices and the default.

**Section A — Issue tracker.**

> Explainer: The "issue tracker" is where issues live for this repo. Skills like `to-tickets`, `triage`, `to-spec`, and `qa` read from and write to it — they need to know whether to call linear MCP, backlog MCP, write a markdown file under `.scratch/`, or follow some other workflow you describe. Pick the place you actually track work for this repo.

Default posture: these skills were designed for Linear. Propose Linear as issue tracker but also offer:

- **GitHub** — issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab** — issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI)
- **Backlog.md** — issues live as files under `.backlog/` in this repo (good for solo projects or repos without a remote), needs backlog MCP
- **Other** (Jira, etc.) — ask the user to describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill will record it as freeform prose

If Linear is chosen, also ask **under which Linear project tickets for this repo should be tracked**. Offer both options: pick an existing project (use `list_projects` to show candidates) or create a new one (`save_project`). Record the chosen project in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` so skills pass it when creating issues.

**Section B — Triage label vocabulary.**

> Explainer: When the `triage` skill processes an incoming issue, it moves it through a state machine — needs evaluation, waiting on reporter, ready for an AFK agent to pick up, ready for a human, or won't fix. To do that, it needs to apply labels (or the equivalent in your issue tracker) that match strings *you've actually configured*. If your repo already uses different label names (e.g. `bug:triage` instead of `needs-triage`), map them here so the skill applies the right ones instead of creating duplicates.

The five canonical roles:

- `needs-triage` — maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info` — waiting on reporter
- `ready-for-agent` — fully specified, AFK-ready (an agent can pick it up with no human context)
- `ready-for-human` — needs human implementation
- `wontfix` — will not be actioned

Default: each role's string equals its name. Ask the user if they want to override any. If their issue tracker has no existing labels, the defaults are fine.

**Section C — Domain docs.**

> Explainer: Some skills (`improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `tdd`) read a `CONTEXT.md` file to learn the project's domain language, and `docs/adr/` for past architectural decisions. They need to know whether the repo has one global context or multiple (e.g. a monorepo with separate frontend/backend contexts) so they look in the right place.

Confirm the layout:

- **Single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. Most repos are this.
- **Multi-context** — `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (typically a monorepo).

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to `AGENTS.sgiath.md` (never `AGENTS.md`)
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

Write the `## Agent skills` block into `AGENTS.sgiath.md` at the repo root, creating the file if needed. If the file is not listed in `.gitignore` (or a global ignore), add it — it being git-ignored is expected, since it holds personal instructions not shared with the team. If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked, plus whether external PRs are a triage surface]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

[one-line summary of the label vocabulary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of layout — "single-context" or "multi-context"]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Then write the three docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-linear.md](./references/issue-tracker-linear.md) — Linear issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-backlog.md](./references/issue-tracker-backlog.md) — Backlog.md issue tracker
- [triage-labels.md](./references/triage-labels.md) — label mapping
- [domain.md](./references/domain.md) — domain doc consumer rules + layout

For "other" issue trackers, write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from scratch using the user's description.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later — re-running this skill is only necessary if they want to switch issue trackers or restart from scratch.

If Linear was chosen, offer to enrich the chosen Linear project with more info (description, summary of the repo, links to the remote, relevant Shortcut stories, etc.) via `save_project`. Only do so if the user accepts.
